Notes on the starter code for the PatchMatch algorithm

---------------
GENERAL REMARKS
---------------

A. STARTER CODE

  The top-level python executable is

     code/viscomp.py

  You can run it by calling 

     cd code
	 python viscomp.py --help
	
  to see its input arguments.

  Check the directory test_images/jaguar2/README.txt for an example of how to
  run the code for one of the supplied datasets.

B. GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE ALGORITHM'S RESULTS

  1. I am supplying the full result of running the reference solution on CDF,
  including all the intermediate results, for the dataset test_images/jaguar2.
  Get the algorithm's output after each iteration to see what NNF it computes,
  how it improves after each iteration and how the reconstructed source image
  improves as well.

  2. In addition to the results, I am also supplying the timings of running
  the code on CDF as well as a relatively recent iMac. These timings should be
  used as a guide only since they may be affected by other programs running on
  the machine concurrently.

C. GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE STARTER CODE

  1. The code can (almost) be executed out of the box: just complete the image
  reading/writing functions from your A1/A2 implementation into the
  code/patchMatch.py file and the code will be ready to run.

  2. Once you've completed those functions, it is possible to execute the code
  and compute an NNF that is written to output. This NNF will be initialized
  to a random NNF as required by the PatchMatch algorithm but will NOT improve
  after each iteration because the algorithm's main iteration does nothing
  (you need to complete it).

  3. The jaguar2/ dataset requires just a couple of iterations to converge.
  For the other datasets 4-5 iterations will be necessary. Experiment with
  patch sizes on the size of 7 to 15. Use larger patches only if necessary and
  only after you've already debugged your algorithm as it can take a long time
  to run.


D. COMPLETING THE STARTER CODE

  1. You should start by implementing the reconstruct_source_from_target()
  function. This will allow you to assess the quality of the reconstructed NNF
  by looking at how well the source image was reconstructed.

  2. Once you're convinced that function is working correctly, implement the
  random search procedure of patchmatch. After that is done, incorporate the
  propagation procedure as well.

STRUCTURE OF THE CODE
---------------------

1. GENERAL NOTES

  * code/viscomp.py
       top-level routine 

2. IMPORTANT: 

  We will be running scripts to test your code automatically. To 
  ensure proper handling and marking, observe the following:

  * All your code should go in the following files:
  		code/algorithm.py 
        code/patchMatch.py
  * The only modification you will do to patchMatch.py
    is to transfer the read/write functionality you implemented in A1 as these
    are not provided in the A3 starting code either.
  * Do not modify any other python files
  * Do not modify any parts of the above files except where specified
  * Do not add any extra files or directories


3. GENERAL STRUCTURE

  The implementation centers on a single class called
  PatchMatch, defined in patchMatch.py. An instance of this
  class is created when the program is first run. It 
  contains private variables that hold all the input and
  output images, methods for reading/writing those
  variables from/to files, etc.


  patches. This is defined in psi.py. You will need to get very 
  familiar with this class. The functions in copyutils.py may also 
  be useful (although most of their functionality is encapsulated
  in the PSI class).

4. FILES IN THE DIRECTORY code/

   nnf.py
   			Start from here, after reading the paper and running the
   			starter implementation. This file describes how
			nearest-neighbor fields are represented. 
			The file is heavily commented so study it carefully. 
			Functions to look at in this file are:
    			* init_NNF(): the most important function, 
				  which creates the NNF.
    			* create_NNF_image(): look at this file to understand 
				  how NNFs are visualized as a color image. You will need 
				  to understand this function very well because this is 
				  the main mechanism you have to debug your algorithm, 
				  and to know whether the field you compute is what 
				  you expect

   algorithm.py	
			This is where your implementation goes. The functions 
			you must implement are fully specified here. In addition
			to those functions, you must read carefully and understand
			the following two utility functions:
			   * make_patch_matrix(): This function takes an image
			     and generates a matrix of patches. You will need to
			     understand the structure of the patch matrix since
			     you will be processing its contents in your 
			     implementation. 
			   * make_coordinate_matrix(): another extremely important
			     function that you should use as much as possible in
			     your code. Be sure to understand how loops are
			     avoided with the help of functions that operate on
			     matrices.
			
   patchMatch.py
            Implementation of the PatchMatch class. This provides the
 			data structure that contains private variables used by the
			method. Look at the method's initializer to see the default
			values of the various parameters. This is where you should
			place your A1 code for reading/writing images.
    
   viscomp.py
            Code for processing arguments and creating an instance of the
			PatchMatch class. You do not need to look at this file.
