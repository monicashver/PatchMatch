# The most important data structure in the PatchMatch algorithm is the one representing
# the nearest-neighbour field (NNF). As explained in Section 3 of the paper, this is a vector
# field f over the image, ie. a mapping from pixel coordinates (x,y) to
# 2D displacements f(x,y). Here we will represent a displacement field as a numpy matrix.
# Given a NxM openCV source image, the nearest-neighbour field is a matrix of size NxMx2
#

# The following method generates an NNF that is a just random displacement field.
# Specifically, it assigns to each pixel (y,x) in the input image a nearest neighbor
# that is a random pixel in the image.
#
# This is done by first generating a pair of random numbers for each image pixel
# and then subtracting those numbers from the pixel's coordinates. In this way,
# the generated random numbers are turned into 2D *displacements*
